The afcharts python package helps make accessible Matplotlib and Plotly charts that meet [Government Analysis Function best practice](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/).

This cookbook includes a [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) guide and example code for various chart types in [Matplotlib](01-matplotlib-usage.qmd) and [Plotly](03-plotly-usage.qmd).

# Package features

- **Automatic chart formatting** with pre-built style sheets for Matplotlib and Plotly. These set a variety of chart properties to meet the Analysis Function accessibility guidance for charts, such as fonts, axes and grid lines.
- **Chart colours** from the Analysis Function [accessible colour palettes](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/#section-4) for data visualisation. These palettes were designed with experts to maximise clarity and accessibility.
- **Example code for common chart types** such as line charts, bar charts, scatterplots and small multiples. Re-use these code snippets for your own charts to save time and repeat best practices.

Accessibility note: Chart titles and alternative text for all example charts can be found in the body text directly beneath each example.
