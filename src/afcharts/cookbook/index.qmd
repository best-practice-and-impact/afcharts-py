This cookbook provides example code to produce various chart types using `afcharts-py`. There are also examples to demonstrate how to apply further customisation to `afcharts-py` charts.

If there is a chart type or task which you think would be useful to include here, please [submit a suggestion](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/afcharts-py/issues/new?&labels=documentation&title=Cookbook+suggestion).
