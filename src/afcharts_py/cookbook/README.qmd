Geocomputation with Python is an open source book project that will be published as a physical book.
We are developing it in the open and publishing an up-to-date online version at <https://py.geocompx.org>.

## Dependencies

Running the code that is part of Geocomputation with Python (geocompy for short) requires the following dependencies to be installed:

1. Python dependencies, which can be installed with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), a package manager or a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container (see below)
2. An integrated development environment (IDE) such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (running locally or on [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=447558863)/other host) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy/tree/main/ipynb) for running and exploring the Python code interactively
3. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is used to generate the book


## Reproduce the book
<details>
You can now reproduce the book (requires quarto to be installed):
