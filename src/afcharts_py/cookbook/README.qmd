## Dependencies

Running the code that is part of Geocomputation with Python (geocompy for short) requires the following dependencies to be installed:

1. Python dependencies, which can be installed with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
2. An integrated development environment (IDE) such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (running locally or on [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=447558863)/other host) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy/tree/main/ipynb) for running and exploring the Python code interactively
3. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is used to generate the book


## Reproduce the book
