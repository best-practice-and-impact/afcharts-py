This is test folder to determine whether custom style sheets work in matplotlib. This script will use the custom stylesheet attached and print a scatter plot of arbitrary data so any changes can be clearly observed in layout.

Many of the parameters in the style sheet ./images/af_test.mplstyle are derived from the R af-charts stylesheet for ggplot.

You can alter parameters such as font size in the style sheet to determine whether the test script is working for y ou.

Some of the more complex parameter changes may need to be edited in the matplotlibrc file however, as the similarities in functionality in ggplott and matplotlib aren't completely like for like.
